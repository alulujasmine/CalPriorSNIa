# **CalPriorSNIa**
## Effective calibration prior on the absolute magnitude of Supernovae Ia

**priorM.nb** quickly computes the effective calibration prior on the absolute magnitude M_B of the Supernovae Ia used to obtain a given determination of H_0. See Camarena & Marra [arXiv:1906.11814](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11814) for more details.

Have fun,
